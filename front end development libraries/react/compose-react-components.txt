Compose React Components

As the challenges continue to use more complex compositions with React components and JSX, there is one important point to note. Rendering ES6 style class components within other components is no different than rendering the simple components you used in the last few challenges. You can render JSX elements, stateless functional components, and ES6 class components within other components.

In the code editor, the TypesOfFood component is already rendering a component called Vegetables. Also, there is the Fruits component from the last challenge.

Nest two components inside of Fruits â€” first NonCitrus, and then Citrus. Both of these components are provided for you behind the scenes. Next, nest the Fruits class component into the TypesOfFood component, below the h1 heading element and above Vegetables. The result should be a series of nested components, which uses two different component types.

Tests
Waiting:The TypesOfFood component should return a single div element.
Waiting:The TypesOfFood component should return the Fruits component.
Waiting:The Fruits component should return the NonCitrus component and the Citrus component.
Waiting:The TypesOfFood component should return the Vegetables component below the Fruits component.
